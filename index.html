    <h2>Design Manifesto</h2>
    <p>When I originally signed up for this class, I thought that I knew what I was signing up for. I have taken design classes in the past, and done web development work where design was a primary focus of the project. This class changed my perspective on what design really meant, teaching me that it was more than just trying to figure out color palettes or fonts (#papyrus). Each of these projects has taught me a lesson about how to make design better</p>

    <p>One of the biggest things I took away from this term’s projects was how design is an ongoing, iterative process. Especially in the first project, Design for Others, I got to see firsthand how much a design could change in just a few shorts weeks. The process of user testing, incorporating people’s feedback to fix flaws was extremely valuable to the project, and majorly influenced how I think of what it means to keep designing a product.</p>

    <p>With Design for Understanding, I learned how to design with intent. Design is about presentation in all aspects, about how your presentation makes the user feel. My role in this project was to work on the persuasive component, and my partner and I used a number of techniques to try to lead the user to the conclusion that we were favoring. We played with the color scheme to make it feel more unassuming and playful so that a user would be more receptive to the presentation. We scaled the volume so that it’s increases would be more noticeable at the top end, almost obnoxious but not quite to the point where one would think it was misrepresented. Our final screen even has a direct, albeit playful, message that makes the user think about what they were listening to.</p>

    <p>With Design for Tension and flowXO, I learned how to balance what people want from an application and what people need from an application. When we were designing the flow of our chatbot, we tried to keep a balance between being too agreeable, which wouldn’t help a user learn anything, and too assertive, which would only push a user away. We tried to make the bot more personable, more lifelike so that a user could engage with it in a real, meaningful way, a concession to the fact that people don’t like to be challenged.</p>

    <p>Design for Wellbeing was a very interesting project. Affectiva was one of the more fun platforms to work with, and it’s open-endedness made it possible to be creative and abstract. That creative aspect, interpreting emotions into something more concrete, was very different than anything else we had done during the term, where the projects had more substantial boundaries and requirements. I had always thought about design, at least for a website, in terms of layout and content and the presentation of the content. I had never really been aware of the environment that the content was presented in, and the simple question we came up with, “what if we change the colors”, made me reconsider that aspect, as it really does influence how you’re consuming the information. The kind of out-of-the-box thinking that this project prompted definitely impacted my approach to the design process, as you’ll see next in Design for Another World.</p>

    <p>Design for Another World asked us to be creative. Really creative. “Here are the elements that this API lets you play with, have fun” creative. Very early on, my group knew that we wanted to do something with a creepy vibe, some kind of a monster game like Slenderman with fog and trees and a jumpscare to really make the user feel the environment. We had a number of technical challenges getting the horror aspect into play and decided to pivot to a simpler approach, the one that we debuted, with the snowfall and piano music setting a much lighter tone. However, remembering my lesson from Design for Wellbeing, I suggested we also test an alternate version of the same exact world, with different music to change the ambiance. This change proved so effective in testing that we had multiple people who had enjoyed the first iteration tell us that they were expecting a jump-scare or some sort of a monster to appear in the world.</p>

    <p>I learned a lot of things from this class, both large and small, and I know that I will never approach design the same way again, no matter what form it takes. From websites to data to virtual reality, I have gotten a look behind the scenes at how and why I, and everyone else, makes the choices that they make. One of the most valuable experiences of this class, for my own enrichment and development of opinions was the Demo Day time. Not just for getting other people’s feedback, but for getting to go around and see what other people’s approach to very similar problems were. There were a lot of trends I noticed in trying people’s designs, from how many teams favored a certain type of layout on their websites, to how so many people picked similar conversation topics and datasets. There are classes that could have taught me how to present data in a really flashy and effective manner, or how to make a super-involved and realistic VR world, but this class taught me how to approach all of these problems and think about them like a designer.</p>
